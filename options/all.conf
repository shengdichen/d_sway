#   Includes another file from path. path can be either a full path or a path
#   relative to the parent config, and expands shell syntax (see wordexp(3) for
#   details). The same include file can only be included once; subsequent
#   attempts will be ignored.
#
#       include <path>
#
# this is repeatedly used in the main sway config file:
#       ~/.sway/config
# for modularity


#   Executes custom background command. Default is swaybg. Refer to
#   sway-output(5) for more information.  It can be disabled by setting the
#   command to a single dash: swaybg_command -
#
#       swaybg_command <command>
#
swaybg_command swaybg


#   Executes custom command for swaynag. Default is swaynag. Additional
#   arguments may be appended to the end. This should only be used to either
#   direct sway to call swaynag from a custom path or to provide additional
#   arguments. This should be placed at the top of the config for the best
#   results.  It can be disabled by setting the command to a single dash:
#   swaynag_command -
#
# refere to swaynag(1) for additional arguments
#       swaynag_command <command>
#
swaynag_command swaynag
