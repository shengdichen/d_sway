#   Specifies that workspace name should be shown on the specified outputs.
#   Multiple outputs can be listed and the first available will be used. If the
#   workspace gets placed on an output further down the list and an output that
#   is higher on the list becomes available, the workspace will be moved to the
#   higher priority output.
#
#   This command does not affect existing workspaces. To move an existing
#   workspace, use the move command in combination with the workspace criteria
#   (non-empty workspaces only) or workspace command (to switch to the
#   workspace before moving).
#       workspace <name> output <outputs...>
