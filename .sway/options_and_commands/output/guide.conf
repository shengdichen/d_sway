# available commands:
#       output <output_name> <output-subcommands...>
# NOTE:
#   1.  for <output_name>, view output devices with:
#       $ swaymsg -t get_outputs
#   2.  for <output-subcommands>, see section COMMANDS of sway-output(5)

# Apart from using |output <...> <some_subcommand>| in keybinds, it may also be
# used in shell with swaymsg.
# E.g., using swaymsg to directly to disable an output (blank the screen)
#       $ swaymsg output eDP-1 toggle
#
# following the train of thought of activating and deactivating the output
# device(s), now as a keybind:
#   <output-subcommands> is:
#         enable/disable/toggle
#
# temporarily switch off the screen
