# available commands:
# see sway-output(5) for more detail
#       output <output_name> <output-subcommands...>
#
#
# <output_name> specifies the target output device of the <output-subcommands>.
# A list of output devices can be obtained with:
#       $ swaymsg -t get_outputs
#
# <output-subcommands> are commands specifically targeted at manipulating the
# output of sway. These commands are found under COMMANDS of sway-output(5)

# Apart from using |output <...> <some_subcommand>| in keybinds, it may also be
# used in shell with swaymsg.
# E.g., using swaymsg to directly to disable an output (blank the screen)
#       $ swaymsg output eDP-1 toggle
#
# following the train of thought of activating and deactivating the output
# device(s), now as a keybind:
#   <output-subcommands> is:
#         enable/disable/toggle
#
# temporarily switch off the screen
