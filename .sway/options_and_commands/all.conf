#   variable to be replaced at run time since some arguments do need to be
#   known at config time.

# GUIDE {{{
# GUIDE: bindings {{{
#   Binds key combo to execute the sway command command when pressed. You may
#   use XKB key names here (xev(1) is a good tool for discovering these). With
#   the flag --release, the command is executed when the key combo is released.
#   If input-device is given, the binding will only be executed for that input
#   device and will be executed instead of any binding that is generic to all
#   devices. If a group number is given, then the binding will only be
#   available for that group. By default, if you overwrite a binding, swaynag
#   will give you a warning. To silence this, use the --no-warn flag.
#
#   Unless the flag --locked is set, the command will not be run when a screen
#   locking program is active. If there is a matching binding with and without
#   --locked, the one with will be preferred when locked and the one without
#   will be preferred when unlocked. If there are matching bindings and one has
#   both --input-device and --locked and the other has neither, the former will
#   be preferred even when unlocked.
#
#   Bindings to keysyms are layout-dependent. This can be changed with the
#   --to-code flag. In this case, the keysyms will be translated into the
#   corresponding keycodes in the first configured layout.
#
#   Mouse bindings operate on the container under the cursor instead of the
#   container that has focus. Mouse buttons can either be specified in the form
#   button[1-9] or by using the name of the event code (ex BTN_LEFT or
#   BTN_RIGHT). For the former option, the buttons will be mapped to their
#   values in X11 (1=left, 2=middle, 3=right, 4=scroll up, 5=scroll down,
#   6=scroll left, 7=scroll right, 8=back, 9=forward). For the latter option,
#   you can find the event names using libinput debug-events.
#
#   The priority for matching bindings is as follows: input device, group, and
#   locked state.
#
#   --whole-window, --border, and --exclude-titlebar are mouse-only options
#   which affect the region in which the mouse bindings can be triggered. By
#   default, mouse bindings are only triggered when over the title bar. With
#   the --border option, the border of the window will be included in this
#   region. With the --whole-window option, the cursor can be anywhere over a
#   window including the title, border, and content. --exclude-titlebar can be
#   used in conjunction with any other option to specify that the titlebar
#   should be excluded from the region of consideration.
#
#   If --whole-window is given, the command can be triggered when the cursor is
#   over an empty workspace. Using a mouse binding over a layer surface's
#   exclusive region is not currently possible.
#
#   Example:
#
#   	# Execute firefox when alt, shift, and f are pressed together
#   	bindsym Mod1+Shift+f exec firefox
#       bindsym [--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar] [--release] [--locked] [--to-code] [--input-device=<device>] [--no-warn] [Group<1-4>+]<key combo> <command>


#   is also available for binding with key/button codes instead of key/button names.
#       bindcode [--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar] [--release] [--locked] [--input-device=<device>] [--no-warn] [Group<1-4>+]<code> <command>


#   Binds <switch> to execute the sway command command on state changes.
#   Supported switches are lid (laptop lid) and tablet (tablet mode) switches.
#   Valid values for state are on, off and toggle. These switches are on when
#   the device lid is shut and when tablet mode is active respectively. toggle
#   is also supported to run a command both when the switch is toggled on or
#   off.
#
#   Unless the flag --locked is set, the command will not be run when a screen
#   locking program is active. If there is a matching binding with and without
#   --locked, the one with will be preferred when locked and the one without
#   will be preferred when unlocked.
#
#   If the --reload flag is given, the binding will also be executed when the
#   config is reloaded. toggle bindings will not be executed on reload. The
#   --locked flag will operate as normal so if the config is reloaded while
#   locked and --locked is not given, the binding will not be executed.
#
#   By default, if you overwrite a binding, swaynag will give you a warning. To
#   silence this, use the --no-warn flag.
#
#   Example:
#
#   	# Show the virtual keyboard when tablet mode is entered.
#   	bindswitch tablet:on busctl call --user sm.puri.OSK0 /sm/puri/OSK0 sm.puri.OSK0 SetVisible b true
#   	# Log a message when the laptop lid is opened or closed.
#   	bindswitch lid:toggle exec echo "Lid moved"
#       bindswitch [--locked] [--no-warn] [--reload] <switch>:<state> <command>



#   Removes a binding for when <switch> changes to <state>.
#       unbindswitch <switch>:<state>


#   Removes the binding for key combo that was previously bound with the given
#   flags. If input-device is given, only the binding for that input device
#   will be unbound.
#       unbindsym [--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar] [--release] [--locked] [--to-code] [--input-device=<device>] <key combo>


#       unbindcode [--whole-window] [--border] [--exclude-titlebar] [--release] [--locked] [input-device=<device>] <code> is also available for unbinding with key/button codes instead of key/button names.
