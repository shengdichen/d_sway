#   Includes another file from path. path can be either a full path or a path
#   relative to the parent config, and expands shell syntax (see wordexp(3) for
#   details). The same include file can only be included once; subsequent
#   attempts will be ignored.

#       include <path>

#   Enables or disables Xwayland support, which allows X11 applications to be
#   used. enable will lazily load Xwayland so Xwayland will not be launched
#   until the first client attempts to connect. In some cases, such as slower
#   machines, it may be desirable to have Xwayland started immediately by using
#   force instead of enable.
