#   To set this up for optimal latency:
#   1.  Set up output max_render_time.
#   2.  Put the target application in full-screen and have it continuously render
#       something.
#   3.  Start by setting max_render_time 1. If the application drops frames,
#       increment by 1.
#   see sway-output(5) for more details
#       max_render_time off|<msec>
